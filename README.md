## Start.gg set data web scraping tool

Note: I only tested this with google chrome. The auto copy functionality might not work with other browsers, but with some small modifications this script can work with those too.

1. navigate to the bracket
2. hit f12
3. paste javascript into the console
4. hit enter (tab delimited data will be copied to your clipboard)
5. paste into spreadsheet

Output columns: Player 1 tag, player 1 score, player 2 tag, player 2 score. The output includes a row for every set played.
